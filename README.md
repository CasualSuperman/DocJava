DocJava
=======
This is intended to make starting new projects in my major easier, as I can just
call DocJava and generate a skeleton of the project. Granted, this will probably
take more effort than just writing all the code myself, but I'll learn by doing.

Better Masks
------------------
This branch is intended to investigate ways to further reduce code repetition in
the mask sub-system of DocJava. This will probably be done with methods on Masks
that take a slice of Masks to compare against.
