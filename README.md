DocJava
=======
This is intended to make starting new projects in my major easier, as I can just
call DocJava and generate a skeleton of the project. Granted, this will probably
take more effort than just writing all the code myself, but I'll learn by doing.

Experimental Masks
------------------
This branch is intended to investigate ways to reduce code repetition in the
mask sub-system of DocJava. It has succeeded.
